INTRODUCTION

This text file is used purely as a development notebook to log down any changes that have been made. This is to ensure that progress during ongoing development is recorded down so that it is not lost to the wind, and that the developer is not lost to the wind during debugging/development.

This only covers the high-level thought process during development. Any changes to the code is not recorded down for simplicity sake. 

DEBUGGING

When debugging, set parameter DEBUG in receptorCounter(~,~,debug) to the following debug commands:
	- 'all': Spits out everything
	- 'segmentation': Analyses only segmentation

During production, set parameter DEBUG to 'none'.
